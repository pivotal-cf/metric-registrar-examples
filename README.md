### Register the endpoint
To register an app's metric endpoint with the Metric Registrar, run:

```
cf register-metrics-endpoint <APP_NAME> /actuator/metrics
```

### Make sure the app is emitting metrics
To look at all the counters emitted by an app, run:

```
cf tail -f --envelope-type=counter <APP_NAME>
```

To look at all the gauges emitted by an app, run:

```
cf tail -f --envelope-type=gauge <APP_NAME>
```

If you don't see anything contact your platform support to enable the Metric Registrar.
